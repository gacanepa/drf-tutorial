# A frontend dude comes to Backendville

This repo stores my code and notes while going over the [DRF tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/). Each part of the tutorial has a subdirectory with an individual README inside of **tutorial**

### Developer tools

- Install [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/), and [pylint-django](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-django/) in addition to the packages listed in the requirements file.
